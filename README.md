## Briefing

This is the training data needed for the California Socioeconomic Correlations challenge

This data is organised in the following way: 

- BG_METADATA_2016 contains the mapping between long variable names and short Variable names
The rest of the .csvs have all of the data you are interrested in. 
- The rows correspond to a block group and you should use either "OBJECTID" or "GEOID" to correlate the data
between the csvs. The columns are the features, you can use BG_METADATA_2016 to map the variable names from 
short to long if you wish.

(This is recommended as it allows you to have a conceptual understanding of the data)
